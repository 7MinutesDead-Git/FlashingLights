# FlashingLights
Scripts for a Unity game project. 
While this particular project isn't going to become a game, it is a staging area for me exploring neat logic to be used later in an actual game. 
You can poke around the scripts here if you'd like.

Example of all scripts in action, particularly FlashingLights.cs and RandomRoadElevations.cs.
